[**Image registration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration) is the process of transforming different sets of data into one coordinate system. Data may be multiple photographs, and from different sensors, times, depths, or viewpoints.

It is used in computer vision, medical imaging, military automatic target recognition, compiling and analyzing images and data from satellites. Registration is necessary in order to be able to compare or integrate the data obtained from different measurements.
